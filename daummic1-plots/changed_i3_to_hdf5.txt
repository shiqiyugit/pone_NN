This document is a summary of major changes to count number of hits per DOM/PMT.

Note: due to the way I butchered the pone_i3_to_hdf5 file to work for gen2 I'd 
just copy and paste from this file rather than try and re-adapt it for pone.
There are also summary variables and features used for PMTs since there are
multiple PMTs per DOM in gen2, but I don't think pone is using these special DOMs,
so these lines can be ignored to save memory.

HDF5 conversion

Lines 82-86: summary variable dictionary created with keys
Lines 218-234: calculation of hits per DOM
Lines 255-258: conversion of lists to hdf5 friendly format
Lines 260-263: add summary variables to dictionary
Line 280: summary group created for hdf5
Lines 286-291: summary data added to group

Note: the functions called need to be adapted to include summary, should be fairly
simple to just add it in as an argument and return (I replaced reco with it since
gen2 doesn't have any reco)

Plotting

Lines 20-27: define arrays to store summary data (the frag_* arrays are if you
wanted the data fragmented to look at individual files rather than everything,
but it takes a lot more memory, so I'd recommend leaving those commented out)
Line 34: read in summary dataset
Lines 41-44: extract summary data
Lines 60-75: pull out individual counts from arrays
